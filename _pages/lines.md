# Generative Adversarial Networks for the improvement of astronomical image.

This research line is currently addressing state of the art GAN architectures in the following cases.

### VIRTIS-M images

Generative networks to improve S/N ratio in Venus Express VIRTIS-M images. Lower exposure times are used to generate examples of images, base truth are images with higher exposure times and S/N ratio.
